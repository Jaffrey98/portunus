## Summary
Portunus (named after the Greek God of Keys) is a robust approach towards verifying the identity of an individual by using Brain Biometrics. It has been proved by multiple researchers that the EEG signals obtained from an individual is unique enough to identify an individual.


## Motivation
Biometrics have been used for authentication purposes since long. However, traditional biometrics such as fingerprints, voice recognition, iris, etc have been recently compromised due to advancement in Artificial Intelligence.
